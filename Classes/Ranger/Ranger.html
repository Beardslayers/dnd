                <p>
                    Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the 
                    shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a 
                    raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, 
                    he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy 
                    after another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf 
                    finds her feet and draws back to her bow to loose an 
                    arrow at the white dragons. Shrugging off the wave of 
                    fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its 
                    breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the 
                    gaps between the dragon's thick scales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk 
                    that circles high above him, calling the bird back to 
                    his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points 
                    to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk 
                    to distract the creature while he readies his bow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges 
                    that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of 
                    the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests 
                    and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their 
                    unending watch.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Deadly Hunters
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting 
                    the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid 
                    raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, 
                    terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track 
                    their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through 
                    the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. 
                    Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are 
                    particularly useful against their specific favored foes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire 
                    the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much 
                    as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, 
                    emphasize, speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents 
                    and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task 
                    of protecting the borderlands.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Independent Adventurers
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, 
                    or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the 
                    outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and 
                    humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, 
                    rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic 
                    circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, 
                    knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger 
                    might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, 
                    since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry 
                    bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse 
                    and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with 
                    some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Ranger
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the 
                    training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you 
                    train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until 
                    you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, 
                    or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that 
                    became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part 
                    of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in 
                    mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, 
                    a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical 
                    connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's the source of your skill and devotion as a hunter? Did a monster 
                    kill someone you loved or destroy your home village, and you swore to 
                    never permit it again? Or did you see too much of the destruction these 
                    monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is 
                    your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the 
                    borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band 
                    of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways 
                    of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

            </p>
            <h2 id="expertise">
                Expertise
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 1st level, choose one of your skill proficiencies. 
                Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check 
                you make using the chosen skill.
            </p>
            <h2 id="favored_enemy">
                Favored Enemy
            </h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience 
                studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain 
                type of enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose two types of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, 
                celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, giants, 
                monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, 
                instead of one of these types, you can choose two races 
                of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Wisdom (Perception) 
                checks to track or notice your favored enemies, as well as on 
                Intelligence (Nature) checks to recall information about them. 
                In addition, when you hit your favored enemies with a weapon 
                attack, you deal an additional 1d4 damage. This damage increases 
                to 1d6 at 6th level and 1d8 at 10th level.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your 
                choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one 
                at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                You choose a additional favored enemy, as well as a single associated 
                language, at 6th and 10th level. As you gain levels, your choices 
                might reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your 
                adventures.
            </p>
            <h2 id="roving">
                Roving
            </h2>
            <p>
                Also at 1st level, your walking speed increases by 5, and you 
                gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking 
                speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 5th level, your walking speed increases by an additional 5.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Spellcasting
            </h2>
            <p>
                By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the 
                magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spell Slots
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast 
                your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
                these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or 
                higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish 
                a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you know the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a> 
                and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you 
                can cast 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a> 
                using either slot.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/RangerSpellList.html>ranger spell list</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn 
                more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be 
                of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you 
                reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st 
                or 2nd level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose 
                one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell 
                from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/RangerSpellList.html>ranger spell list</a>, 
                which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since 
                your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom 
                whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, 
                you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a 
                ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Focus
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.
            </p>
            <h2 id="fighting_style">
                Fighting Style
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your 
                specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a 
                Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to 
                choose again.
            </p>
            <p> 
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace your chosen 
                Fighting Style know with another Fighting Style available to rangers.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Archery:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls

                    <strong>Blind Fighting:</strong> You have blindsight with 
                    a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively 
                    see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're 
                    blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible 
                    creature within that range, unless the creature successfully 
                    hides from you.
                </li>
