                    Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and 
                    unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an 
                    inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from 
                    her back and she takes to the air.

                    Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his 
                    arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily 
                    off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, and a hound
                    of shadow claws its way out of his chest and leaps at his enemies.

                    Crouching behind a stalagmite, a hobbit points a finger at a 
                    charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger 
                    to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation 
                    with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin 
                    bright blue.

                    Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by 
                    an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure 
                    to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one 
                    learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a 
                    legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the 
                    sorcerer.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Raw Magic
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and 
                    spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some 
                    sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline 
                    infused with magic. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic 
                    within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. 
                    Some bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, 
                    but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. 
                    Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent 
                    flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, 
                    while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. 
                    The touch of an aberration, the blessing of a dryad at a 
                    baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring 
                    might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity 
                    of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or 
                    the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings 
                    of reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sorcerers have no use for the formal learning that bards and 
                    wizards depend on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their 
                    spells as clerics and warlocks do. By learning to harness and 
                    channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and 
                    staggering ways to unleash that power.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Unexplained Powers
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a 
                    sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some 
                    way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon 
                    discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's 
                    magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out 
                    in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them 
                    to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force 
                    that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others 
                    hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. 
                    Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an 
                    adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of 
                    breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using 
                    the spells they do know.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Sorcerer
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer 
                    is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose 
                    an origin that ties to some innate form of magic, but the exact source 
                    of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down 
                    to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave 
                    you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you 
                    embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? 
                    Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? 
                    Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do 
                    you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this 
                    power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives 
                    you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who 
                    lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual 
                    in the world—the fey that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a 
                    drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an 
                    experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry power.

            <p>
                The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your 
                sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer 
                spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain 
                all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you 
                know the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WitchBolt.html>Witch Bolt</a> 
                and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WitchBolt.html>Witch Bolt</a> 
                using either slot.

                Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/SorcererSpellList.html>sorcerer spell list</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer 
                spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which 
                you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 
                3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of 
                the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer 
                spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since 
                the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will 
                into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your 
                spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when 
                setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when 
                making an attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

            <p>
                You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

            <p>
                At 1st level, choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the 
                source of your innate magical power. Choose one of the powers of the

                Your choice grants you origin spells and other features when you

                Metamagic
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself and 
                gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. This ability 
                is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of 
                magical effects. You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach 
                higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. 
                You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. 
                You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You gain three of the following Metamagics of your choice. You gain 
                another three at 5th, 7th, and 10th level.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Careful Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that forces 
                    other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of 
                    those creatures from the spell. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery 
                    point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma 
                    modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically 
                    succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no 
                    damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cheapened Spell:</strong> When casting a spell that requires
                    a costly material component, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reduce 
                    the required cost of the component by up to 50 gp (minimum cost of 0).
                    If the reduced cost is 0, you do not need to provide the material
                    component. When casting a spell that requires a material component 
                    with no cost, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast the spell without
                    providing the material component.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Distant Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a range
                    of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
                    range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch,
                    you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.
                    This Metamagic can be used on a spell a maximum of twice per casting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Empowered Spell:</strong> When you roll damage for a spell, 
                    you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice 
                    up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and use the new rolls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extended Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a 
                    duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to 
                    double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Focused Spell:</strong> When you fail a Constitution saving
                    throw made to maintain concentration on a spell, you can spend 1 
                    sorcery point to reroll the Constitution saving throw.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Heightened Spell:</strong> When a creature makes a saving throw
                    against a spell cast by you, you can spend 1 sorcery point to give that 
                    creature disadvantage on its saving throw.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quickened Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a 
                    casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change 
                    the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Seeking Spell:</strong> When you make an attack roll for a 
                    spell and miss, you can spend 1 sorcerer point to reroll the d20 
                    and use the new roll.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subtle Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell, you can spend 
                    1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transmuted Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that deals 
                    acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can spend 
                    1 sorcery point to change the damage type to one of the other listed 
                    types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Twinned Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that can be cast 
                    with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you 
                    can spend 1 sorcery point to increase the spell's effective level by 1.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can use a number of Metamagics equal your 
                proficiency bonus on a spell.
                You can apply one Metamagic to a spell multiple times, 
                with each application counting as an additional 
                Metamagic applied to the spell.

                Starting at 3rd level, you can use your sorcery points to gain additional
                spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot on your turn
                (no action required). The Sorcery Points Cnversion table shows the cost of 
                creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher 
                in level than one quarter of your sorcerer level (rounded down), and once 
                you have created two spell slots, you cannot create any more until you finish 
                a long rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you 
                finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also transform spell slots into sorcery points. You can expend a spell 
                slot to gain a number of sorcery points corresponding to the slot's level, as shown
                in the Sorcery Points Conversion table.
