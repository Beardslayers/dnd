                    Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, 
                    an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to 
                    heal his battle-worn companions.

                    Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths 
                    to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting 
                    praise to the gods with every foe's fall.

                    Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts 
                    her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies 
                    crowding in on her companions.

                    Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant 
                    planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive 
                    to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric 
                    is imbued with divine magic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some serve gods as agents of healing and magic, while others serve the
                    will of their deities as warriors. Regardless of their chosen path,
                    each cleric is a conduit for the power of the divine, and the mere
                    whiff of a cleric's presence can bring terror to the forces that 
                    oppose them.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Healers and Warriors
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing 
                    from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, 
                    manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power 
                    to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high 
                    calling. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training.
                    A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the 
                    ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive 
                    sense of a deity's wishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their 
                    allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke 
                    awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down 
                    flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers 
                    who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on 
                    their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power 
                    of the gods on their side.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Divine Agents
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. 
                    Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying 
                    out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic 
                    and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a 
                    political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of 
                    authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics 
                    are rare in most hierarchies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because 
                    his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often 
                    involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting 
                    evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also 
                    expected to protect their deities' worshippers, which can mean 
                    fighting rampaging orc, negotiating peace between warring nations, 
                    or sealing a portal that would allow a prince of aberrations to enter 
                    the world. Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to 
                    established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask 
                    for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Cleric
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which 
                    deity or domain to serve and what principles your character will embody. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've chosen a deity or a domain, consider your cleric's relationship 
                    to that god or domain. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did a god 
                    choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How 
                    do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? 
                    What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for 
                    you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?

            <p>
                At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/ClericSpellList.html>cleric spell list</a>. 
                You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, 
                as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the

            <h3>
                Preparing and Casting Spells
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast 
                your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
                spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. 
                You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you 
                to cast, choosing from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/ClericSpellList.html>cleric spell list</a>. 
                When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom 
                modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be 
                of a level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level 
                and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list 
                of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, 
                in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a>, 
                you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the 
                spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. 
                Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and 
                meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power 
                of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use you 
                Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. 
                In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving 
                throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll 
                with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <p>

                Channel Divinity
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly 
                from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You 
                start with three such effects: Turn Undead, Harness Divine Power, 
                and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you 
                additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the 
                domain description.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to 
                create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your 
                Channel Divinity again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use 
                such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell 
                save DC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice 
                between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three 
                times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you 
                regain your expended uses.

                Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
            </h3>
            <p>
                As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer 
                censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 
                30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature 
                fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it 
                takes any damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away 
                from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 
                30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it 
                can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that 
                prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature 
                can use the Dodge action.

            <p>
                As a bonus action, you can touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, 
                and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no 
                higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number 
                of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've 
                reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 
                18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish 
                a long rest.

                Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a

                If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level,

                spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't
