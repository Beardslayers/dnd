                    Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons 
                    the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning 
                    to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, 
                    a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple 
                    of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the invaders' activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass 
                    of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the 
                    creatures the mocking semblance of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the 
                    creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's 
                    resilience, cunning, and fury. The claim no mastery over nature. 
                    Instead they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some druids focus on shaping the terrain around them, while others 
                    channel the power of nature into their own bodies. No matter the 
                    method, when a druid steps on the warpath, nature and the elements 
                    themselves lend their aid.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Power of Nature
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other 
                    magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from 
                    a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of 
                    transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine 
                    entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or 
                    elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes 
                    called the Natural Religion, in contrast to the worship of gods 
                    in temples and shrines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of 
                    tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also 
                    gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make 
                    a particular study of this practice, even to the point where 
                    they prefer animal form to their natural form.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Preserve the Balance
                </h4>
                <p>
                    For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements 
                    that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. 
                    If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be 
                    destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into 
                    its component elements. Thus, druids oppose factions of Elemental Evil 
                    and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that 
                    sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to 
                    live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept 
                    that which is cruel in nature, and they that that which is unnatural, 
                    including aberrations and undead. Druids sometimes lead raids against 
                    such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' 
                    territory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions 
                    of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening 
                    nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active 
                    role in combating the threat, as adventurers.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Druid
                </h4>
                <p>
                    When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond 
                    with nature. Perhaps your druid lives in a society where the Natural 
                    Religion still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned 
                    in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter 
                    with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire 
                    wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character experienced 
                    an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which your character interpreted 
                    as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, 
                    or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? 
                    Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring 
                    life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

                Equipment
            </h3>
            <p>
                You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
                granted by your background:
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon</li>
                    <li>(a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
                    <li>Leather armor, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus</li>
                </ul>
                Alternatively, you can buy your own equipment, starting with 44 gp, 8 sp, and 3 cp.

                Druidic
            </h2>
            <p>
                You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the 
                language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who 
                know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot 
                the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
                check but can't decipher it without magic.
            </p>

                Spellcasting
            </h2>
            <p>
                Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells 
                to shape that essence to your will.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Cantrips
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/DruidSpellList.html>druid spell list</a>. 
                You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, 
                as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the 
                druid cantrips you know with another cantrip from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/DruidSpellList.html>druid spell list</a>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Preparing and Casting Spells
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast 
                your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
                spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. 
                You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you 
                to cast, choosing from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/DruidSpellList.html>druid spell list</a>. 
                When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom 
                modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be 
                of a level for which you have spell slots.
            <p>
                For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level 
                and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list 
                of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, 
                in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a>, 
                you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the 
                spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. 
                Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in thought and 
                meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic 
                draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use you Wisdom 
                whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you 
                use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell 
                you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <h3>
                Ritual Casting
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has 
                the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Focus
            </h3>
            <p>

                Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume 
                the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this 
                feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or 
                long rest.

                Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as 
                shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can 
                transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower 
                that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

                You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half 
                your druid level. You then revert to your normal form unless you 
                expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal 
                form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically 
                revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
            </p>
            <p>
                While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, 
                    but you retain your alignment, personality, proficiency bonus, 
                    and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain 
                    all your skill and saving throw proficiencies in addition to 
                    gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same 
                    proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than 
                    yours would be, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the 
                    creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. 
                    When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of 
                    hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert 
                    as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries 
                    over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in 
                    animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 
                    damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal 
                    form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action 
                    that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. 
                    Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already 
                    cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a 
                    spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other 
                    source and can use them if they do not depend upon your normal form's 
                    body. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as 
                    darkvision, unless your new form also has that feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, 
                    merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions 
                    as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new 
                    form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and 
                    size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new 
                    form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall 
                    to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form 
                    has no effect until you leave the form.

                At 2nd level, you gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes 
                an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape 
                feature to cast the Find Familiar spell, without material components.

            <p>
                When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a beast instead 
                of a fey.

                Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you

                Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells 
                in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform 
                the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in

                At 20th level, you are fully connected with the forces of nature. 
                You can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of 
                times, and if you use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast 
                of CR 1 or lower, you assume hit points and Hit Dice equal to 
                twice those of the beast.

                Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components 
                of your druid spells, as well as any material components that 
                lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit 
                in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
