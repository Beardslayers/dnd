                    Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, 
                    a half-elf spring over a barricade and throws herself into 
                    the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls 
                    among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, 
                    until she stands alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a 
                    battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales 
                    and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad hobbit steps 
                    into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky 
                    shadow on a balcony a stone's throw away. She slides her blade 
                    free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open 
                    window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

                <p>
                    Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to 
                    harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled 
                    as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of 
                    defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some monks choose to direct their energy into their bodies, 
                    shifting their fists into natural weapons or enhancing their
                    speed and movement beyond normal bounds. Others hone their
                    minds, creating magical effects through meditation. Yet all
                    monks, whatever their focus, are united in an absolute
                    control of their bodies that allows them to move and fight
                    with exceptional speed and skill.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The Energy of Life
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Monks make careful study of the natural energy of life. 
                    This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the 
                    universe—specifically, the element that flows through 
                    living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves 
                    to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical 
                    capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder 
                    the flow of energy in their opponents. Using this energy, 
                    monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed 
                    strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training 
                    and their mastery of vital energy gives them more power 
                    over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Perfect Discipline
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Monks are set apart from the common warrior by their
                    abilities, which ride the border between natural and
                    magical. While most soldiers and fighters rely on weapons 
                    and armor to win battles, monks rely primarily on their 
                    bodies and skills to see them through. Monks use the perfect
                    control they maintain over their bodies to move like no
                    other, dodging blows and harm with ease and delivering
                    precise, powerful strikes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some monks live in community with the surrounding population, 
                    honing their discipline against the distractions of the world. 
                    Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies 
                    or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, 
                    or some other mortal or divine power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For most monks, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured 
                    lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, 
                    and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their 
                    homes take their work seriously, approaching their adventures 
                    as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As 
                    a rule, monks are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater 
                    mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their 
                    treasure.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Monk
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you make your monk character, think about how you learned 
                    your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan 
                    or a child left on a monastery's threshold? Did your parents 
                    promise you to an old master when your skills became apparent?
                    Did you enter this regimented life to hide from a crime you 
                    committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider why you began adventuring. Were you chosen for a 
                    particularly important mission? Perhaps you were cast out 
                    of your community because of some rule violation. Did you 
                    dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something 
                    you hope to accomplish in your adventures? Are you eager 
                    to return to your home?

            <h2 id="dexterous_combat">
                Dexterous Combat
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you have learned to fight nimbly and with precision.
                You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and 
                damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which 
                are simple melee weapons, improvised weapons, and any martial melee 
                weapons that have the light property. In addition, when you would 
                make an Athletics check in an attempt to grapple or shove a creature, 
                you can instead make an Acrobatics check.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons,
                and you aren't wielding a shield, you can use a bonus action on your
                to make one unarmed strike.

            <h2 id="martial_arts">
                Martial Arts
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of 
                combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons. Your unarmed 
                strikes are considered light weapons, and you can roll a d6 in place 
                of the normal damage of your unarmed strike and in place of the normal 
                damage die of a monk weapon. This die becomes a d8 at 6th level, 
                a d10 at 11th level, and a d12 at 17th level.

            <p>
                At 2nd level, while you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding 
                a shield, your speed increases by 10 feet and you can use your Dexterity 
                score instead of your Strength score to calculate your jump distance. 
                This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in 
                the Monk table.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces 
                and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move, 
                you ignore difficult terrain, and your jump distance is doubled.
            </p>
            <h2 id="energy_points">
                Energy Points
            </h2>
            <p>
                Also starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the 
                energy of life within you. This energy is represented by a number of 
                energy points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, 
                as shown in the energy points column of the Monk table. You can spend 
                energy points to fuel various effects, which you gain as you level up.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you spend an energy point, it is unavailable until you finish a 
                short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended 
                energy back into yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of your energy point features require your target to make a saving throw to 
                resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Energy save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
            </p>
            <p>
                If you spend an energy point as part of an action, you can spend

            </p>
            <h2 id="flurry_of_blows">
                Flurry of Blows
            </h2>
            <p>
                Immediately after you take the Attack action or spend an energy point 
                as part of an action on your turn, you can spend 
                1 energy point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 10th level, the number of unarmed strikes made as part of 
                this bonus action increases to three.
            </p>
            <h2 id="deflect_attacks">
                Deflect Attacks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, when you are hit by a weapon attack, 
                you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the attack. 
                When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced 
                by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you reduce a ranged weapon attack's damage to 0, you can 
                immediately spend 1 energy point as part of the same reaction 
                to make a ranged attack against the creature that attacked you. 
                You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your 
                weapon proficiencies, and the attack deals an amount of damage 
                equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity 
                modifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you reduce a melee weapon attack's damage to 0, you can 
                immediately spend 1 energy point as part of the same reaction 
                to redirect the force and make an unarmed strike against 
                a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. If the 
                attack hits, roll your Martial Arts die twice instead of 
                once and add the result together when determining damage.

                Stunning Strike
            </h2>
            <p>
                Also at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of energy in an 
                opponent's body. Once per turn, when you hit another creature with

                Starting at 6th level, your training empowers your strikes to deal 
                great damage. Your attacks deal double damage to objects and structures, 
                and your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming 
                resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

                At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of 
                the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning 
                breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect 
                that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only 
                half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the 
                saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
