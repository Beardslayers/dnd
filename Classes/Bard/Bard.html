                    Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument 
                    in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers 
                    finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by 
                    the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed 
                    the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.

                    A stern human warrior whips his sword rhythmically through the 
                    air, setting the tempo for his blade's strokes and exhorting 
                    his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his graceful 
                    movement fortifies and emboldens them.

                    Laughing as she dons her actor's mask, a gnome weaves her subtle 
                    magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' 
                    words will be well received.

                <p>
                    Whether scholar or scoundrel, sculptor or musician, a bard 
                    weaves magic through art and performance to inspire allies, 
                    demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even 
                    heal wounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some, artistic power shows itself as physical creations,
                    sculptures or paintings used to inspire power and shape the world.
                    For others, the power is in the performance, the words and music
                    that shape emotions and minds. Each bard, however, is a master of
                    their chosen arts, channeling the magic of the world into their 
                    artistic expression, and using their artistic expression to change 
                    the world around them.

                <h4>
                    Music and Magic
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In the worlds of D&D, art is not just vibrations of air or pleasing shapes,
                    but conjurations with power all their own. The bard is a master of 
                    creation, creativity, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the 
                    multiverse was inspired into existence, that the visions of the gods 
                    gave it shape, and that echoes of these First Inspirations 
                    still resound throughout the cosmos. The artistry of bards is an attempt 
                    to snatch and harness those echoes, woven into their spells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards 
                    prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire 
                    their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable 
                    of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster 
                    their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather 
                    than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of 
                    many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. 
                    Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, 
                    from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Learning from Experience
                </h4>
                <p>
                    True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing 
                    in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. 
                    Discovering the magic hidden in art requires hard study and some measure 
                    of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard 
                    to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. 
                    A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering inspiration, creating 
                    art, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. 
                    But a depth of knowledge, a level of artistic skill, and a touch of magic set 
                    bards apart from their fellows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire 
                    to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries 
                    beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every 
                    adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter 
                    long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, 
                    travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to 
                    accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an 
                    awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. 
                    Indeed, after creating so many works of art about heroes accomplishing mighty 
                    deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles.
                </p>

                    Creating a Bard
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's 
                    background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she 
                    tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good 
                    story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a 
                    hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards 
                    acquire their magical art through extraordinary means, including the inspiration 
                    of fey or other supernatural creatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more 
                    experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you 
                    attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical 
                    magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering 
                    bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored 
                    by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for 
                    a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

            <p>
                The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells 
                of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend 
                a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell 
                slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a> 
                and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, 
                you can cast 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a>  
                using either slot.

                The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard 
                spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which 
                you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 
                3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic 
                comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music 
                or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
                ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving 
                throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

                You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the 
                ritual tag.

            <p>
                You can use a musical instrument or artist's implements as a spellcasting

                Bardic Inspiration
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can inspire others through your art. To do so, you use a bonus action 
                on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of 
                you who can hear or see you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, 
                a d6. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once within the next hour, when the creature fails an ability check, 
                attack roll, or saving throw, it can roll the die and add the 
                number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. 
                Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier 
                (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. 
                The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

                Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music, oration, or art to help 
                revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any 
                friendly creatures who can see or hear your performance regain hit points 
                at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 
                1d6 hit points.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: 
                to 2d6 at 9th level, to 3d6 at 13th level, and to 4d6 at 17th level.

                At 2nd level, if a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and 
                casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature 
                can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the 
                number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt.
