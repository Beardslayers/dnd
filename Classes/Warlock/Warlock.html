                    With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in 
                    golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his 
                    honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.

                <p>
                    As flames sprint to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers

                    Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment 
                    of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic 
                    ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.

                    Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric 
                    of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of 
                    supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle 
                    and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such 
                    as fey nobles, dragons, aberrations, celestials, and elementals, 
                    warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
                </p>
                <h4>

                </h4>
                <p>
                    A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. 
                    Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is 
                    like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that 
                    serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might 
                    lead a cult dedicated to a prince of aberrations, a chief 
                    aberration, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically 
                    served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is 
                    similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The 
                    warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional 
                    services performed on the patron's behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor alterations 
                    to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness 
                    or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike 
                    bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some 
                    facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light 
                    armor and know how to use simple weapons.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Delvers into Secrets
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, 
                    which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This 
                    thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later 
                    careers as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stories of warlocks binding themselves to monstrous beings are widely 
                    known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not monstrous or evil. 
                    Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, 
                    meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully 
                    aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, 
                    a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the 
                    material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be 
                    slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty 
                    patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, 
                    the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their 
                    goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the 
                    demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

                    Creating a Warlock
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you make your warlock character, you may want to spend some time 
                    thinking about your patron and the obligations your pact imposes upon 
                    you (or at least those you know of). What led you to make the pact, 
                    and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you lured into 
                    summoning an aberration, or did you seek out the whereabouts of an 
                    ancient dragon? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron 
                    find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact 
                    or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play 
                    in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might 
                    drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small 
                    favors you can do between adventures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, 
                    antagonistic, or uneasy? How important does you patron seem to consider 
                    you to be? What part do you know that you play in your patron's plans? 
                    Do you know other servants of your patron?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it 
                    might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find 
                    messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among leaves, or 
                    adrift in clouds—messages only the warlock can see. Other warlocks 
                    converse with their patrons in dreams or visions, or deal with 
                    intermediaries.

                Pact Magic

            <p>
                Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your 
                patron have given you facility with spells.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Cantrips
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WarlockSpellList.html>warlock spell list</a>.
                You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, 
                as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the 
                warlock cantrips you know with another cantrip from the

            <h3>
                Spell Slots
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock 
                spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of 
                those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one 
                of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. 
                You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. 
                For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. 
                To cast the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WitchBolt.html>Witch Bolt</a>, 
                you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WarlockSpellList.html>warlock spell list</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock 
                spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of 
                a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for 
                your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock 
                spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of 
                the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WarlockSpellList.html>warlock spell list</a>, 
                which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

            <h3>
                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, since
                your magic relies on a deep knowledge of your patron's abilities and power. 
                You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
                ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting 
                the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an 
                attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

            <p>
                <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                Spellcasting Focus

                            while you hold the weapon. You perform the 
                            ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can 
                            be done during a short rest.

                        <li>
                            You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it 
                            into an extradimensional space, and it appears 
                            whenever you create your boon weapon thereafter. 
                            You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon 
                            in this way. The weapon ceases being your boon 
                            weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour 
                            ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 
                            1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The 
                            weapon appears at your feet if it is in the 
                            extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

                        <li>
                            Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of 
                            Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three 
                            cantrips and two 1st-level spells that have the ritual 
                            tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list 
                            (the spells needn't be from the same list). While the 
                            book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at 
                            will, and you can cast those spells as rituals. If they 
                            don't appear on the

                            You can use your Book of Shadows as a spellcasting focus.

                        <li>
                            If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour 
                            ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This 
                            ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and 
                            it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when 
                            you die.

                            Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that 
                            can aid the wearer when needed. When the wearer 
                            fails a saving throw, they can add a d4 to the 
                            roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. 
                            This benefit can be used a number of times equal 
                            to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses

                            This ceremony can be performed during a short or 
                            long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The
