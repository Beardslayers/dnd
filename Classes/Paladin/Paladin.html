                    Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the 
                    dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword 
                    and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. 
                    Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit 
                    closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making 
                    him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war 
                    band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks 
                    into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are 
                    dead before they even realize he is there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to 
                    illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His 
                    spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again 
                    at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes 
                    its hideous darkness.

                <p>
                    Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are 
                    united by their oaths to stand against the forces that 
                    oppose them. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the 
                    witness of a priest, or in a sacred glade before nature 
                    spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation 
                    and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's 
                    oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that 
                    turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The Power of an Oath
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A paladin swears to uphold their principles, to stand 
                    with their allies against the encroaching enemy, and 
                    to hunt their opponents wherever they lurk. Different 
                    paladins focus on various aspects and causes, but all 
                    are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their 
                    sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of 
                    good, a paladin's power comes as much from their commitment 
                    as it does from a god.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, 
                    mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their 
                    martial skills are secondary to the magical power they 
                    wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite their 
                    enemies, and to protect those who fall under their
                    responsibility.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Beyond the Mundane Life
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Almost by definition, the life of paladin is an adventuring 
                    life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from 
                    adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines 
                    of struggle. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the 
                    militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can 
                    claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive 
                    the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations 
                    and take up arms to fight. Sometimes their oaths lead them 
                    into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups 
                    of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to their cause, 
                    not to crown and country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into 
                    an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a 
                    higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Monsters lurk 
                    in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory 
                    against it can tilt the cosmic balance.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Paladin
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature 
                    of his or her quest. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal 
                    to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor 
                    venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the 
                    light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, 
                    a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the 
                    gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on 
                    those who have done you great harm, sent as an angel of death 
                    by the gods or driven by your need for revenge?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you 
                    hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? 
                    Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train 
                    you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home,
                    perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred 
                    grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect 
                    all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from 
                    your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, 
                    almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose 
                    stamped on your soul.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy 
                    quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods 
                    and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or 
                    your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have 
                    not yet attained.

                Class Features
            </h1>
            <p>
                As a paladin, you gain the following class features.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hit Points
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per paladin level
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 + your Constitution 
                modifier per paladin level after 1st.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Proficiencies
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <h3>
                Equipment
            </h3>
            <p>
                You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
                granted by your background:
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
                    <li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
                    <li>(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
                    <li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>
                </ul>
                Alternatively, you can buy your own equipment, starting with 132 gp and 8 cp.
            </p>
            <h2 id="divine_sense">
                Divine Sense
            </h2>
            <p>
                The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious 
                odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As 
                an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until 
                the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, 
                aberration, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total 
                cover. You know the type (celestial, aberration, or undead) of any 
                being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire 
                Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, 
                you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been 
                consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma 
                modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lay_on_hands">
                Lay on Hands
            </h2>
            <p>
                Your touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that 
                replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can 
                restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool 
                to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum 
                amount remaining in your pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing 
                to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting 
                it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons 
                with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately 
                for each one.
            </p>
            <p>
                This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
            </p>
            <h2 id="sacred_oath">
                Sacred Oath
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever.
                Choose to swear one of the oaths of

                or <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Paladin/Watchers.html>the Watchers</a>, 
                Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 7th, 15th, 
                and 20th level. These benefits include your oath spells and ways to use the 
                Channel Divinity feature.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Oath Spells
            </h3>
            <p>
                Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these 
                spells at the levels specified in the oath description, starting 
                when you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level. Once you gain 
                access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared, and oath spells 
                don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
            </p>
            <h2 id="fighting_style">
                Fighting Style
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of 
                fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following 
                options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than 
                once, even if you later get to choose again.
            </p>
            <p> 
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace your chosen 
                Fighting Style know with another Fighting Style available to paladins.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Blessed Warrior:</strong> You learn two cantrips of 
                    your choice from the 
                    <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/ClericSpellList.html>cleric spell list</a>. 
                    They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your 
                    spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this 
                    class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip 
                    from the 
                    <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/ClericSpellList.html>cleric spell list</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Blind Fighting:</strong> You have blindsight with a range 
                    of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything 
                    that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in 
                    darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that 
                    range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Defense:</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dueling:</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one 
                    hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Great Weapon Fighting:</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 
                    on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that 
                    you are wielding with two hands, you can treat the roll as worth
                    half the maximum roll of the die. For example, if you rolled a 
                    1 or 2 on a d10, you would treat it as a 5. The weapon must 
                    have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this 
                    benefit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interception:</strong> When a creature you can see 
                    hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, 
                    you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target 
                    takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 
                    damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial 
                    weapon to use this reaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> While you are wielding a shield,
                    each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you that is not 
                    wielding a shield gains a +1 bonus to AC.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast 
                your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or 
                higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. 
                You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for 
                you to cast, choosing from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/PaladinSpellList.html>paladin spell list</a>. 
                When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma 
                modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). 
                The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level 
                and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of 
                prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any 
                combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/CureWounds.html>Cure Wounds</a>, 
                you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the 
                spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. 
                Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer 
                and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on 
                your list.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since 
                their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use 
                your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. 
                In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving 
                throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll 
                with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellcasting Focus
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon 
                attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the 
                target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 
                for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher 
                than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the 
                target is an undead or an aberration, to a max of 6d8.
            </p>

                Divine Health
            </h2>
            <p>
                By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune 
                to disease.
            </p>
            <h2 id="channel_divinity">
                Channel Divinity
            </h2>
            <p>
                Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects.
                You start with three such effects: Harness Divine Power and two effects
                determined by your oath. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your 
                oath explains how to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. 
                You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity 
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such 
                an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can use your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus 
                action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one 
                expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half 
                your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can 
                use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class:
                3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain 
                all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, 
                you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, increase two ability scores of 
                your choice by 1, or gain one <a class="body_link" href=/Feats/Feats.html>feat</a> 
                of your choice. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this 
                feature.

                you take the Attack action on your turn.

                Aura of Protection
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 
                feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to 
                the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus 
                of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

                By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your 
                melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a 
                creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
