                    Signaling for her companions to wait, a hobbit creeps 
                    forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to 
                    the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the 
                    lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into 
                    the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to 
                    kick the door open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice 
                    prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a 
                    notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries 
                    out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade 
                    cuts his throat before he can make a sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically 
                    lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys 
                    are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions 
                    are free to make their escape.

                    Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to 
                    get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding 
                    the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a 
                    resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any 
                    successful adventuring party.

                <h4>
                    Skill and Precision
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of 
                    skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving 
                    them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many 
                    rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the 
                    skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, 
                    finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute 
                    strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing 
                    it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear 
                    an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost 
                    supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical 
                    tricks to supplement their other abilities.

                <h4>
                    A Shady Living
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up 
                    to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, 
                    assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are 
                    organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues 
                    operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices 
                    to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest 
                    living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be 
                    a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened 
                    criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while 
                    others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have 
                    learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of 
                    infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Rogue
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you create your rogue character, consider the character's 
                    relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are 
                    you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? 
                    Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger 
                    rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some 
                    other desire or ideal?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? 
                    Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate 
                    your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you 
                    the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust 
                    finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found 
                    yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to 
                    find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another 
                    member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities 
                    for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

            <h2 id="expertise">
                Expertise
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one 
                of your skill proficiencies and your thieves' tools proficiency. 
                Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make 
                that uses either proficiency. At 6th level, you can choose two 
                more proficiencies to gain this benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your 
                choices for Expertise with a different Expertise.
            </p>
            <h2 id="sneak_attack">
                Sneak Attack
            </h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit 
                a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 to 
                one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the 
                attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of 
                the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, 
                and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in 
                this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.
            </p>
            <h2 id="thieves_cant">
                Thieves' Cant
            </h2>
            <p>
                During your rogue training, you learned thieves' cant, a secret 
                mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages 
                in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows 
                thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer 
                to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used 
                to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous 
                or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether 
                the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house.
            </p>
            <h2 id="cunning_action">
                Cunning Action
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to 
                move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns 
                in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, 
                or Hide action.
            </p>
            <h2 id="roguish_archetype">
                Roguish Archetype
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities.
                Choose one of the archetypes of
                <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Rogue/ArcaneTrickster.html>Arcane Trickster</a>,

                or <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Rogue/Thief.html>Thief</a>, 
                Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
            </p>
            <h2 id="steady_aim">
                Steady Aim
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can give yourself advantage on 
                your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus 
                action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you 
                use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current 
                turn.
            </p>
            <h2 id="ability_score_improvement">
                Ability Score Improvement
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, 
                you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, increase two ability scores of 
                your choice by 1, or gain one <a class="body_link" href=/Feats/Feats.html>feat</a> 
                of your choice. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this 
                feature.
            </p>
            <h2 id="uncanny_dodge">
                Uncanny Dodge
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an 
                attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
            </p>
            <h2 id="evasion">
                Evasion
            </h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area 
                effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you 
                are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw 
                to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the 
                saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
            </p>
            <h2 id="reliable_talent">
                Reliable Talent
            </h2>
            <p>
                By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach 
                perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your 
                proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
            </p>
            <h2 id="blindsense">
                Blindsense

            <p>
                Starting at 14th level, you gain 15 feet of blindsight.

            </h2>
            <p>
                By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency 
                in Wisdom saving throws.
            </p>
            <h2 id="elusive">
                Elusive
            </h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper 
                hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't 
                incapacitated.
            </p>
            <h2 id="successful_maverick">
                Successful Maverick
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 20th level, you have an marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If 
                you miss with an attack roll, fail an ability check, or fail a saving throw, you
                can turn the d20 roll into a 20.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or 
                long rest.
