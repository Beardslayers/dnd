                    Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes 
                    her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and 
                    begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front her, she completes 
                    her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, 
                    where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

                <p>
                    Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate 
                    magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles 
                    powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle 
                    is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space 
                    inside the circle, bringing a stale whiff of air from the 
                    otherworldly plane beyond.

                <p>
                    Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses 
                    a handful of bones inscribed with symbols, muttering words of 
                    power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, 
                    he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage 
                    to his left.

                    Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class 
                    by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic 
                    that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, 
                    arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. 
                    Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, 
                    glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their 
                    mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors 
                    down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

                <p>
                    Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of 
                    magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some 
                    aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though 
                    the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance 
                    of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch 
                    or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely 
                    hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship 
                    and countless hours of study.

                    Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. 
                    They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. 
                    They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes 
                    or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) 
                    that are steeped in magic.

                <h4>
                    The Lure of Knowledge
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely 
                    to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a 
                    library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. 
                    Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military 
                    forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous 
                    wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into 
                    crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their 
                    counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have 
                    been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the 
                    path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Wizard
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least 
                    one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact 
                    with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you 
                    have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice 
                    incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome 
                    that taught you the basics of magic?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of 
                    magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word 
                    of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by another 
                    wizard? Perhaps you're simply eager to put your newfound magical 
                    skills to the test in the face of danger.

                Spellcasting
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing 
                spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Cantrips
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WizardSpellList.html>wizard spell list</a>.
                You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, 
                as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the 
                wizard cantrips you know with another cantrip from the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WizardSpellList.html>wizard spell list</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Spellbook
            </h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard 
                spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard 
                spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. The 
                spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane 
                research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs 
                you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other 
                spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a 
                scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in 
                an ancient library.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong> When you find a wizard
                spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is
                of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time
                to decipher and copy it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copying a spell into your spellbook involves
                reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
                system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice
                the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then
                transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.
                The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment
                with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record
                it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell
                just like your other spells.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Replacing the Book.</strong> You can copy a spell from your own
                spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup
                copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your
                spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation
                and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and
                10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe
                the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
                remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as
                normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong> Your spellbook is a unique
                compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin
                notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received
                as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in
                an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged
                together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Preparing and Casting Spells
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
                of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
                slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
                when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast.
                To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to
                your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell).
                The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

                For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and
                two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
                prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
                combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
                spell <a class="body_link" href=/Spells/WitchBolt.html>Witch Bolt</a>,
                you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
                doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
                Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your
                spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to
                cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
                list.

                Spellcasting Ability
            </h3>
            <p>
                Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since 
                you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. 
                You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
                ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting 
                the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an 
                attack roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

            </h3>
            <p>
                You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag 
                and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell 
                prepared.

                You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

                Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
            </h3>
            <p>
                Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your 
                choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level 
                for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your 
                adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.

                Arcane Recovery
            </h2>
            <p>
                You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your 
                spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose 
                expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined 
                level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), 
                and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two 
                levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell 
                slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
