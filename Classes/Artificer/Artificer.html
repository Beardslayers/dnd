                    With unnatural speed, a gnome dashes away from the pursuing giant, 
                    and his armor opens to let him inside before sliding closed behind him. 
                    He turns around and clenches his fist, 
                    and the gem on his gauntlet begins to spark with lightning.

                    A slender elf slips behind a long tube of wrought iron, 
                    and as she pats it lovingly, 
                    it erupts with flames, burning the zombie horde.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As poison erupts from slits in the walls, 
                    an elderly woman cackles in amusement and strolls forward.
                    A steel cage embedded in her chest pulses rhythmically, 
                    and she slams her steel prosthtetic arm through the stone door 
                    barring her way forward.

                    Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic 
                    to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. 
                    They see magic as a complex system just waiting to be 
                    decoded and harnessed by their spells and inventions.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Understanding and Application
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Much of the world views magic as an unsolvable mystery, 
                    an enigma that can never be understood. To an artificer, 
                    on the other hand, magic is a puzzle, just waiting for the 
                    right pieces to be put into place. Their lives are dedicated 
                    to finding those pieces, and then to using their discovered 
                    knowledge to create great things. To an artificer, there is 
                    no such thing as the unknowable, only the as-yet-unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While an artificer has some skill at improvising, 
                    their greatest ability is in preparation. While other 
                    classes create solutions in the moment, an artificer will 
                    create solutions weeks or months in advance, constructing 
                    the perfect device to solve a problem, no matter when 
                    that problem may come.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    New Experiences
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Not every craftsman is an artificer. Some people simply 
                    take their skills and apply them to creation. They may 
                    study to complete a specific job, but in general they are 
                    content with their knowledge and the skills they already have. 
                    An artificer is set apart by their insatiable appetite for new 
                    applications of their knowledge. They want to do new things, to 
                    change what can be done, and to create heaven-and-earth-defying 
                    tools. An artificer is proud of what they have done, but what 
                    they have done is in the past, and for an artificer, the greatest 
                    joy is in tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because artificers are not prone to improvisation, their adventuring 
                    capabilities may be weak as a solo wanderer. Without an adventuring 
                    party, artificers often find themselves becoming tied down, 
                    trapped in a town or city an unsure of where to go next. When 
                    paired with a party, however, an artificer will often be the most 
                    enthusiastic about visiting new places. An artificer may understand 
                    the importance of a job that requires staying in one location, and 
                    they will likely have a home base or two, where they keep their 
                    more fine-tuned or heavy-to-move tools. But they will always be 
                    looking for the next opportunity to leave, even if they come back 
                    home at the end.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating an Artificer
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Since an artificer is defined by their curiosity 
                    and creativity, think about where those traits 
                    came from. Did a craftsman parent inspire them to 
                    always look and understand? Did a glimpse of a 
                    passing sorcerer spark their curiosity about the 
                    unknowns of the world? Or were they dismissed by 
                    academic snobs who were convinced they could never 
                    understand the truth?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond those basic traits, consider what inspired 
                    your artificer to adventure. Curiosity and creativity 
                    could both be achieved in a quiet forge or workshop, 
                    staying in one place. So what made your character 
                    leave the comfort of a stationary life? Did they 
                    grow up in a small town with limited resources, 
                    and so had to leave in order to learn? Did they 
                    grow up near a university, but decide a practical 
                    education would be better? Or did they grow up on 
                    the move, and a life of adventure is actually fairly 
                    stationary compared to what they're used to?
