                    A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she 
                    runs toward the massive goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded 
                    leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite 
                    bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants 
                    coordinate their assault to the best advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and 
                    his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf 
                    in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles 
                    the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

                <p>
                    A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident 
                    and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's 
                    delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with 
                    blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters 
                    in the worlds of D&D. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal 
                    champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as 
                    fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, 
                    and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well 
                    acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly 
                    in the face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the concept of a fighter is simple—a warrior who trains to
                    perfect the use of weapons and armor—fighters themselves can take
                    on many forms. Some fighters are brutes clad in heavy armor, wading
                    into battle with a greatsword, while others are tacticians, leading 
                    their allies into battle and inspiring them to greatness. No matter 
                    their appearance and methods, Fighters share one unifying characteristic: 
                    an unparalleled mastery of weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge 
                    of the skills of combat.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Power of Nature
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can 
                    swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, 
                    use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. 
                    Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. 
                    Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes 
                    in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on 
                    fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their 
                    martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability 
                    and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on 
                    battlefields and in dungeons alike.

                <h4>
                    Trained for Danger
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or 
                    the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively 
                    untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. 
                    Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated 
                    knights, and similar figures are fighters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The 
                    dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common 
                    among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that 
                    different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater 
                    risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the 
                    city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue 
                    sword, for example.

                <h4>
                    Creating a Fighter
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of 
                    your character's background: Where did you get your combat 
                    training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors 
                    around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra 
                    help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? 
                    What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your 
                    homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might 
                    all have been factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a 
                    local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning 
                    strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished 
                    but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to 
                    escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud 
                    family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They 
                    might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you 
                    scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now 
                    among your most important possessions—the only things that stand 
                    between you and death's embrace.

                You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. 
                Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting 
                Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
            </p>
            <p> 
                When you gain a level in this class, you can replace your chosen 
                Fighting Style know with another Fighting Style available to fighters.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Archery:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls 
                    you make with ranged weapons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Blind Fighting:</strong> You have blindsight with a 
                    range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything 
                    that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. 
                    Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless 
                    the creature successfully hides from you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Defense:</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dueling:</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one 
                    hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Great Weapon Fighting:</strong> When you roll a 1 or 2 
                    on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that 
                    you are wielding with two hands, you can treat the roll as worth
                    half the maximum roll of the die. For example, if you rolled a 
                    1 or 2 on a d10, you would treat it as a 5. 
                    The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property 
                    for you to gain this benefit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interception:</strong> When a creature you can see 
                    hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, 
                    you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target 
                    takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 
                    damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial 
                    weapon to use this reaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> While you are wielding a shield,
                    each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you that is not 
                    wielding a shield gains a +1 bonus to AC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Superior Technique:</strong> You learn one maneuver 
                    of your choice from among those available to the 
                    <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Fighter/BattleMaster.html>Battle Master archetype</a> 
                    in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires 
                    your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, 
                    the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency 
                    bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
                    <ul><li>You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added 
                        to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is 
                        used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use 
                        it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short 
                        or long rest.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting:</strong> You can draw a weapon that has
                    the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In
                    addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you
                    gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Two-Weapon Fighting:</strong> When you engage in two-weapon 
                    fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the 
                    second attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unarmed Fighting:</strong> Your unarmed strikes can deal 
                    bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier on a hit. 
                    If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the 
                    attack roll, the d4 becomes a d6. <ul><li>At the start of each of 
                        your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature 
                        grappled by you.</li></ul>
