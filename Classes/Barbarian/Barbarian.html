                    A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, 
                    draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he 
                    charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority 
                    over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her 
                    bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the 
                    face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored 
                    elbow into the gut of another.

                </p>
                <p>
                    These barbarians, different as they might be, are 
                    defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and 
                    unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger 
                    is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting 
                    assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
                </p>
                <p>

                    For some, their rage springs from a communion with 
                    fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling 
                    reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every 
                    barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle 
                    frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats 
                    of strength.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Primal Instinct
                </h4>
                <p>
                    People of towns and cities take pride in how their 
                    civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying 
                    one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, 
                    though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. 
                    The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, 
                    primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are 
                    uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They 
                    thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, 
                    or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can 
                    enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them 
                    superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw 
                    on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, 
                    but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever 
                    threats arise.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    A Life of Danger
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions 
                    of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian 
                    among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a 
                    town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of 
                    the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild 
                    places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, 
                    deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge 
                    headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly 
                    suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for 
                    their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer 
                    is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the 
                    close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find 
                    them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their 
                    adventuring parties.

                </p>
                <h4>
                    Creating a Barbarian
                </h4>
                <p>
                    When creating a barbarian character, think about where your 
                    character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk 
                    with your GM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. 
                    Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the 
                    area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble 
                    frontier where barbarians are common?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured 
                    to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces 
                    with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did 
                    monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, 
                    making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of 
                    war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able 
                    to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your 
                    people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, 
                    or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

                </ul>
                Alternatively, you can buy your own equipment, starting with 41 gp, 8 sp, and 5 cp.
            </p>
            <h2 id="rage">
                Rage
            </h2>
            <p>
                In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. 
                On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
            </p>
            <p>
                While raging, you gain the following benefits:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
                    <li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, 
                        you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases 
                        as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage 
                        Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>
                    <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are 
                knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't 
                attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken 
                damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn 
                (no action required).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian 
                level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish 
                a long rest before you can rage again.
            </p>
            <h2 id="unarmored_defense">
                Unarmored Defense
            </h2>
            <p>
                While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + 
                your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a 
                shield and still gain this benefit.
            </p>
            <h2 id="danger_sense">
                Danger Sense
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't 
                as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. 
                You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws. To gain this benefit, 
                you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
            </p>
            <h2 id="reckless_attack">
                Reckless Attack
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to 
                attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on 
                your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you 
                advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength until your 
                next turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your 
                next turn.
            </p>
            <h2 id="primal_path">
                Primal Path
            </h2>
            <p>
                At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your Rage. 
                Choose a path from among those of the 
                <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Barbarian/AnimalWarrior.html>Animal Warrior</a>,

                the <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Barbarian/WildMagic.html>Wild Magic</a>, 
                or the <a class="body_link" href=/Classes/Barbarian/Zealot.html>Zealot</a>, 
                Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
            </p>
            <h2 id="primal_knowledge">
                Primal Knowledge
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill 
                of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.
            </p>
            <h2 id="ability_score_improvement">

            <p>
                When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can 
                increase one ability score of your choice by 2, increase two ability scores of 
                your choice by 1, or gain one <a class="body_link" href=/Feats/Feats.html>feat</a> 
                of your choice. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this 
                feature.
            </p>
            <h2 id="extra_attack">
                Extra Attack
            </h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take 
                the Attack action on your turn.
            </p>
            <h2 id="fast_movement">
                Fast Movement
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet.

            <h2 id="feral_instinct">
                Feral Instinct
            </h2>
            <p>
                By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't 
                incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you 
                enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
            </p>

                Instinctive Critical
            </h2>
            <p>
                Beginning at 9th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit 
                on a roll of 19 or 20.
            </p>
            <h2 id="relentless_rage">
                Relentless Rage
            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous 
                wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die 
                outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, 
                you drop to 1 hit point instead.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is
